# Digit-recognition
This project helps to recognize hand written digits. 

# Objective
Given a training data with images and corresponding digits to learn to classify new data among the characters.

#main purpose
In this project three different algorithm(Decision tree, KNN, Random forest ) was implemented. Different algorithm has different efficiency. It also calculate effieciency of
these algorithm and helps to determine which is better.

# To use this follow these instrunctions-
1.Clone this repo into your system.
2.Download MNIST datasets.
3.Make a folder "datasets", inside this folder put dataset file(MNIST datasets).
4.You can use jypter to open these files and to see results.
